    "# 3D Printer ToolHead Detection\n",

    "\n",
    "Project Goal Our project focuses on building a computer vision model that can identify and track the toolhead of a 3D printer. We wanted to create a reliable way to monitor the printer's movements, which is the first step toward catching print failures\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenges We Faced** Since this is a specific niche, we couldn’t find any pre-existing datasets of 3D printer components online. To solve this, we had to build our own dataset from scratch:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Sourcing:** We scraped frames from various YouTube videos to get a wide range of printer models and different lighting setups. This gave us a \"real-world\" variety.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual Annotation:** To ensure the model learned correctly, we used AnyLabeling to manually draw bounding boxes around the toolhead in every image. While this was time-consuming, it allowed us to maintain high quality and accuracy for our \"ground truth\" data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image Preprocessing: To prepare the data for training, we resized all of our scraped images to a standard 224x224 resolution. This step was essential to keep the model efficient and compatible with standard deep learning architectures while still keeping enough detail to recognize the toolhead.\n",

    "**here is an example of what we did:**\n",
